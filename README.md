Algorithms practice based on what I have learned through the Treehouse course Introduction to Algorithms.

# What I have learned so far:
## What is an algorithm?
* An algorithm is just a set of instructions given to complete a task. Depending on how the steps or instruction are defined the time complexity of the algorithm will be affected.
## Algorithm Guidelines
* The algorithm should perform a set of steps or instructions that will be executed in a specific order, 
* The output should be the same every time the steps or instructions get executed.
* The algorithm should always produce an output result even if it's nothing. All results should be represented in the code.
## Algorithm Efficiency
* The efficiency of an algorithm is measured by the order of growth 

## Search algorithms I've learned so far:
1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search
3. Recursive Binary Search (Python and PHP)
